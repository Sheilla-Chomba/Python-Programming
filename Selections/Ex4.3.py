# Below is the programming exercise
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and display the
# result. If ad â€“ bc is 0, report that The equation has no solution.

# Prompts user to type in the value of a, b, c, d, e and f

e=eval(input("Type in the value of e: "))
f=eval(input("Type in the value of f: "))
